		<h3>Cat</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.

		<h3>Dog</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed". The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle") or (as suggested by Piotr Gąsiorowski) the Old English colour adjective dox, meaning "brown" or "tan". In either case, the word seems to have been derived via the diminutive suffix -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.

		<h3>Hamster</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Hamsters are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains about 25 species classified in six or seven genera. They have become established as popular small house pets,but, because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are also often used as laboratory animals.
